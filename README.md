## Our goal
we propose a novel generative adversarial network  that can faithfully reconstruct 12-lead ECG signals from single-lead signal.
our method's ability to effectively reconstruct CVD-related characteristics by evaluating reconstructed ECGs with a highly accurate 12-lead ECG-based prediction model and three cardiologists
