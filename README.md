## Our Goal
We propose a novel generative adversarial network that can faithfully reconstruct 12-lead ECG signals from single-lead signals.
Our method can reconstruct 12-lead ECGs with CVD-related characteristics effectively.
Thus, our method can be used to bridge commonly available wearable devices that can measure only Lead I and high-performance deep learning-based prediction models using 12-lead ECGs.

## EKGAN Architecture

## Experiments
We implemented not only EKGAN but also [Pix2pix](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07004.pdf), [CycleGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf), and [CardioGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.00104.pdf) with minor modifications so that they can be applied to ECG data. Additionally, 12-lead ECGs were generated by using both the validation and test sets, and their quality was evaluated by using a CVD [prediction model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15432-4), comparing the classification performance with the original 12-lead ECGs and the generated ones, and examined by three cardiologists.
